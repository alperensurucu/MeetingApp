# MeetingApp 
# I have created a Meeting App application with the goal of revisiting fundamental concepts and incorporating new learnings to develop a solid foundation.
# Each file is started from scratch as an empty project to instill the MVC template.
# The project includes the establishment of a default routing scheme and the introduction of MVC concepts.
# After incorporating the layout file, I utilized the Libman tool to include client packages in the project.
# Efficient use of ViewBag and ViewData concepts is emphasized throughout the project.
# Data is received using Model Binding, and features like Tag Helpers and form validation have been added to enhance the project.
# Upon completing these steps, the project is considered finished. 
# Wishing everyone a healthy, peaceful, and happy year ahead in this first project of 2024! :)
